# Question 5
**Requirements engineering is the process of identifying, eliciting, analyzing, specifying, validating, and managing the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a software system**  

**The key stages of the requirements engineering process are**:
  1. Feasibility Study: Analyzing the technical, operational, and economic feasibility of the project to determine if it is viable.<br>
  2. Requirements Elicitation: Gathering information about stakeholder needs through techniques like interviews, surveys, workshops, and prototyping.<br>
  3. Requirements Analysis: Analyzing the elicited information to identify high-level goals, objectives, constraints, and limitations.<br>
  4. Requirements Specification: Documenting the requirements in a clear, consistent, and unambiguous manner, prioritizing and grouping them.<br>
  5. Requirements Validation: Checking that the requirements are complete, consistent, accurate, and meet stakeholder needs.<br>
  6. Requirements Management: Managing requirements throughout the lifecycle, including tracking changes and ensuring ongoing validity.<br>

**Requirements engineering is important because it**:
  - Ensures clear communication and shared understanding between stakeholders
  - Improves project planning by enabling accurate estimates, schedules, and risk identification
  - Enhances stakeholder satisfaction by aligning the software with their needs
  - Minimizes rework and costs by identifying issues early
  - Increases product quality by capturing complete, consistent requirements
