# Question 8
**Version control systems (VCS) are software tools that help developers manage and track changes to source code over time. They provide a centralized location where all changes are recorded, allowing multiple developers to collaborate on a project without conflicts or errors.**<br>
**VCSs are crucial in software development because they:**<br>
  1. <em>Maintain Code Integrity:</em>  VCSs ensure that all changes are recorded and tracked, making it easier to identify and fix errors.
  2. <em>Facilitate Collaboration:</em>  VCSs enable multiple developers to work on the same codebase simultaneously, ensuring that everyone is working with the same version of the code.
  3. <em>Provide Backup and Recovery:</em>  VCSs act as a backup system for code, allowing developers to recover from mistakes or accidental changes by reverting to previous versions.
  4. <em>Enhance Productivity:</em>  VCSs streamline the development process by automating tasks, such as code reviews and merging changes, which improves productivity and efficiency.
  5. <em>Improve Code Quality:</em>  VCSs facilitate code reviews, ensuring that code meets quality standards and adheres to coding conventions.
  6. <em>Support Branching and Merging:</em>  VCSs allow developers to create branches for new features or bug fixes, making it easier to manage different versions of the codebase.
  7. <em>Provide Historical Versions:</em>  VCSs maintain a history log of all changes, enabling developers to track changes and understand the evolution of the project


## Some popular version control systems and their features are:

**1. GitHub**<br>
<em><b>Features:</b></em><br>
  - Provides code review that is available in a private cloud with GitHub Enterprise or on-premise deployment.
  - Uses GitHub Marketplace to look for integrations and tools needed to improve your development process further.
  - Offers a secured environment through signed commits, required status checks, and protected branches to maintain high-standard coding practices.
  - Enhances collaboration through code review tools where members can discuss implementation details before applying code.
  - Provides high visibility for all the code parts that are new, edited, or deleted, which are highlighted to spot changes easily and compare versions of code side by side

**2. GitLab**<br>
 <em><b>Features:</b></em><br>
  - Improves productivity by cutting down the DevOps cycle time, reducing manual work, and connecting silos and stages.
  - Provides audit management, cycle analytics, issue board and trackers, source code management, unit testing, and continuous delivery.
  - Lowers development risks through frequent deployments that will lead to better predictability, easier troubleshooting, and better code quality.
  - Defies geographical barriers as distributed, and remote teams can work on the latest version of the code and stay current.

**4. Beanstalk**<br>
<em><b>Features:</b></em><br>
  - Provides robust encryption, two-factor authentication, and password protection functionalities.
  - Allows users to code, commit, review, and deploy using a browser.
  - Can be integrated with messaging and email platforms for efficient collaborations related to codes and updates.
  - Supports both Git and SVN and comes with built-in analytics features.

**6. PerForce**<br>
<em><b>Features:</b></em><br>
  - Delivers the version control capabilities through its HelixCore.
  - Comes with a single platform for seamless team collaboration and support for both centralized and distributed development workflows.
  - Allows users to track the code changes accurately and facilitates a complete Git ecosystem.

**8. Apache Subversion**<br>
<em><b>Features:</b></em><br>
  - Key features include inventory management, security management, history tracking, user access controls, cheap local branching, and workflow management.
  - Is another open source version control system, which was founded by CollabNet a couple of decades ago.

**10. AWS CodeCommit**<br>
<em><b>Features:</b></em><br>
  - Provides a secure, managed source control service that makes it easy to collaborate with your team and manage your code.
  - Supports Git and SVN and integrates with other AWS services like AWS CodeBuild and AWS CodePipeline.
  - Allows users to track changes and collaborate on code with ease.
