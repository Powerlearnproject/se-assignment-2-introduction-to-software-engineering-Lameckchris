# Question 2
**Software Engineering is the process of developing, testing and deploying computer applications by applying engineering principles and best practices.**  

Some of the key differences between software engineering and traditional programming are:  <br>  
        1. Software engineering is concerned with the entire software development process, while programming is focused on writing code to solve a specific problem.  <br> 
             [A real-world example is the development of a mobile banking application. Here software engineering encompasses the entire process from design to maintenance. While traditional programming is focused in writting code to solve specific problems in this whole process.]  <br>          
        2.Software engineering uses well-defined scientific principals and procedures to deliver efficient and reliable software whereas programming is more focused on writing code to execute specific tasks.  <br>
   Bottom line is that software engineering uses the Software Development Life Cycle(SDLC) while traditional programming is code written to execute a specific task
   
**Software Development Life Cycle is a structured process that involves several stages to design, develop, test and maintain high-quality software.**
