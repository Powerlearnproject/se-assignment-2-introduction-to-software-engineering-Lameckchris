# Question 3
**1. Planning and Requirement Analysis**  <br> This stage includes gathering requirements from stakeholders,customers and the  people to use the system. You also identify the strengths and weaknesses of the current system and define the goals for improvements. You also determine the  cost and resources for implimenting the analyzed requirements.  

**2. Design**  <br> This stage is where the software engineer analyzes the requirements and identifies the best solutions to create a software and he/she also designs the product architecture and internal design of modules.  

**3. Implimentation**  <br> This is where the code is written based on the design  specifications acquired during the design stage.  

**4. Testing**  <br> This is where the software is tested for bugs and if it is running and meeting the customer requirements.  

**5. Deployment**  <br> This is where the engineering team deplyos the software to the customers, They can deploy it all at once  or deploy it in sections depending on the method that is convinient to the customer.  

**6. Maintenace**  <br> This is where the engineering team monitor the system perfomance,security and user experience to identify new ways to improve the software and also fix bugs that may arise in the future.

**Agile Mode Emphasizes rapid development and testing, with a focus on customer interaction and continuous improvement. While 
Waterfall Model is a linear and sequential approach where each phase must be completed before moving on to the next step.**
